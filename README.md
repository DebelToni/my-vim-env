# my-vim-env

This is a repository I use (will) to track my env config history because everything gets broken all the time by pressing a single key by accident.

I recently decided to start learning the Vim programming style with Neovim

My crazy setup:
(running everything in wsl2 ubuntu on my windows 10)
- Neovim
- Tmux
- My custom AHK / Kanata scripts to emulate Vim motions outside of terminal
- ...

I have all my configs for all the things listed in the repo folder on my wsl partition and to actually use them i have created symbolic links all over my system so it can access them - it is a super goofy solution but it works so why not.
